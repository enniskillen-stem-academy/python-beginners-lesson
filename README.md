# Python Beginners Lesson

Welcome to the Python Beginners Lesson repository!

This repository is designed for a two-hour coding session for beginners in Python. It includes simple lessons and exercises to help you get started with Python programming. The lessons are organized into two main sections:

- **Topics**: Contains guided lessons covering basic Python concepts such as variables, conditionals, loops, and functions.
- **Exercises**: Provides hands-on coding exercises where you can practice what you've learned. There are also challenges for advanced students.
