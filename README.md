# Python Beginners Lesson

Welcome to the Python Beginners Lesson repository!

This repo includes simple lessons and exercises to help you get started with Python programming. The lessons are organized into two main sections:

- **Topics**: Contains guided lessons covering basic Python concepts such as variables, conditionals, loops, and functions.
- **Exercises**: Provides hands-on coding exercises where you can practice what you've learned. There are also challenges for advanced students.

    Feel free to modify the code, add new functions, or even create your own challenges. The goal is to practice coding and understand the basics of Python.

## Fun Projects

In addition to the lessons and exercises, we've added a couple of fun projects to help you practice Python in a playful way!

- **Guess the Number:**  
    A simple game where the computer chooses a random number, and you try to guess it.  
    Run it with:
    ```bash
    python3 fun/guess_the_number.py
    ```
- **Mad Libs:** 
    Create a silly story by providing some words when prompted.
    Run it with:
    ```bash
    python3 fun/mad_libs.py
    ```
